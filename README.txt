this is my collection of programs written in the processing language, which is a java-based graphics language with an IDE.
I am not affiliated with the processing foundation, nor do I own rights to their software.

To run these projects, you will need the processing development environment environment on your computer, which can be found here:
https://www.processing.org/download/
once it is set up, download this repository and unzip, or clone it. Then use the containing folder of this project to replace the `sketchbook` folder in the processing file structure.
If you don't want to download this stuff onto your computer, you can copy and paste the text in the .pde files into the online sandbox:

these programs are projects I did for my own entertainment.  You may find some entertaining as well.

I discovered this graphics editor through Khan Academy, which has a programming tutorial for a language similar to processing, but based on JavaScript.  I have written other programs there in this processingJS language:
